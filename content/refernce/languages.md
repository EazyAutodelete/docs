EazyAutodelete is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to Discord communities around the world. Whether your server primarily speaks English, Spanish, German, French, or another language, we're working to provide localized experiences.

## Available Languages

To see all currently supported languages and change your server's language preference, use the `/language` command in your Discord server.

The bot will display:
- All available language options
- Current language setting for your server
- Instructions for changing the language
- Translation completion status for each language

### Language Coverage

Different languages may have varying levels of translation completion:
- **Complete**: All bot messages and commands are translated
- **Partial**: Most common messages are translated, some may fall back to English
- **In Progress**: Active translation work is ongoing

---

## Changing Your Server's Language

### Using the `/language` Command

1. Run `/language` in any channel where you have admin permissions
2. View the list of available languages
3. Select your preferred language from the options
4. The bot will confirm the change
5. All bot messages will now appear in the selected language

### What Gets Translated

When you change languages, the following will be translated:
- ✅ Bot command responses
- ✅ Error messages and warnings
- ✅ Configuration menus and prompts
- ✅ Help text and explanations
- ✅ Status messages and notifications
- ✅ Info boxes and hints

### What Doesn't Get Translated

The following remain in their original form:
- ❌ User-written messages (the bot doesn't translate user content)
- ❌ This documentation (primarily in English)
- ❌ Support server channels (multilingual community)
