# ðŸ‘¥ Roles

You can either select to target or to ignore certain roles.

When setting new target roles, the ignore roles will be cleared, and vice versa.

You can select up to 10 roles to target or ignore. When using the [premium.md](../premium.md "mention") version, you can select up to 20 roles.

## Target Roles

Only delete messages from members that have one or more of the selected roles.

All other messages will be ignored and therefore not counted when using mode 3 or mode 4.

## Ignore Roles

Ignore messages from members that have one or more of the selected roles.

All other messages will be ignored and therefore not counted when using mode 3 or mode 4.
