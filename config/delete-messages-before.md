# ⏪ Delete messages before

> **🚨 Danger: This option is no longer available.** The "Delete messages before" feature has been deprecated and removed from EazyAutodelete. This documentation is kept for reference purposes only.

---

## What This Feature Did (Historical Reference)

This setting previously allowed you to delete only messages sent **BEFORE** a specific message, creating an upper temporal boundary for deletion.

### How It Worked:

1. Click the "delete messages before" button
2. Enter the message ID of the boundary message
3. The bot would only delete messages sent before this message

Enter `0` to disable the feature.

## Finding Message IDs (For Other Features)

While this specific feature is no longer available, you may need to find message IDs for other bot features:

**Learn how to find message IDs:**

## Alternative Solutions

If you need similar functionality, consider these alternatives:

1. **Use "Delete messages after"**: Use the [Delete messages after](delete-messages-after.md) feature to set a starting point instead of an ending point
2. **Manual cleanup**: Use Discord's built-in message management or bulk delete bots for one-time historical cleanup
3. **Mode-based timing**: Use different [Modes](mode.md) to control deletion timing
4. **Contact support**: Reach out on our [Support Server](https://eazyautodelete.xyz/discord/) if you have a specific use case that requires this functionality
