# âš™ Mode

Currently 5 different modes are supported.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful when changing the mode. The changes will be applied immediately and the bot will continue to work with the limit of the previous mode.

First set the mode to 0, then change the limit and after that change the mode. This way there is no risk that the bot deletes messages unintentionally.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mode 0" %}
Disables the deletion algorithm in the specified channel
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mode 1" %}
Deletes the sent message after the given time.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mode 2" %}
Deletes all messages in the specified channel after the given time.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mode 3" %}
Deletes all messages after a given amount of messages was sent.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mode 4" %}
Keeps a defined number of new messages and deletes the messages before.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
