# ðŸ‘¥ Roles

You can either select to target or to ignore roles.

When setting new target roles, the ignore roles will be cleared, and vice versa.

## Target Roles

Only delete messages from members that have one or more of the selected roles. All other messages will be ignored and therefore not counted when using mode or mode 4.

## Ignore Roles

Ignore messages from members that have one or more of the selected roles. All other messages will be ignored and therefore are not counted when using mode 3 or mode 4.
